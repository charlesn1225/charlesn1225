- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Charles Nshimiyimana, born and raised in Uganda. Currently, I am attending school at Concordia University-NE, where I am pursuing a degree in IT Administration.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in coding because it falls within the path of my passion for information technology as well as my desire to make the world a better and convenient place. Coding provides me with an opportunity to come up with software solutions that may help ease processes, solve complex problems, and enhance user experience among others. Also, as a Ugandan in the USA, I feel that coding is a universal language which surpasses the barrier of cultural differences; so to communicate with any kind of person from multi-cultural background, this is an effective way. This interest in the coding fits great towards my academic pursuits but also towards a goal of mine, helping others through my African Youth ministry as well as job IT admin.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, JS , CSS and System admin.
